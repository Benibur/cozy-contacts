# TODO

Roadamp for cozy contacts :

## UX

- search on server side
- highlight search result
- scroll with letters for contact list (like on mobile)
- paginate History
- bulk tag management

## Analytics

- best way to contact X (mail, call, sms)
- best time to contact X (never answer before 11)
- best way to contact me
- best time to contact me (linked with obfuscated agenda)
- my contacts on a OpenStreetMap
- Tracker in kyou : sms & call received/sent
    - alert a friend if I stop using my phone

## Mobile

- Android : make the COZY app that export all logs + other data (geoloc, ...)
- iOS : I need help on this as I don't have a iPhone. If you feel like helping,
figure out a way to export iPhone call logs and sms into something readable (csv, json)
for free and for Win, Mac, Linux and open up an issue with a few sample items from the
exported file.
